Based on the data that has been processed by the Data Analysts team, 
to increase user engagement in the m-banking application is to increase
the aspect of having users in the application. The suggestion given 
by the data analysts team is to form a personalize user feature, 
one of which is to allow users to upload images to be used as profile photos.
The developer team is responsible for developing this feature, and you are 
given the task of designing APIs for the upload and delete image features.
Some of the conditions include:
a. Users can add a profile picture
b. The system can identify the user (log in / sign up)
c. Only users who have logged in / signed up can delete / add profile photos
d. Users can delete pictures that have been posted
e. Different users cannot delete / change photos that have been created by other users
